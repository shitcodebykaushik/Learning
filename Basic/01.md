#  The  first step
- This line of the code was written in the different file and then we impported this to 
```python
print("Hi kauhsik raj")

def chai (n):   # Here we define the simple function chai and def is the used as function in the python used to define a function. Which perform the specific task . Here chai (n) is the parameter . 
    print(n)    # This line of the code say that what the function chai will do with the n . HEre is prints
    
chai(4)  # This is the argument as we have passed the actual value into it .add()
chai('Kaushik Raj')

```
- This is the totally different file and we have importe this . 
```python
from first import chai 
chai("Red_Level")
```

- Python also creates the byte code for the actual value which is slighly different from the java and other .
- When we download the python fine then there are actually  one more thing that is downloaded automatically which is python vm .
- Python code is converted into the compile then to the byte code , byte code is low level and the platform independent .
- Byte code run faster than the script code .
- `.pyc` is compiled python also known as the frozen binaries .
- `__pycache__` This is the system folder  generated by the internally and it is used for the imposted files and not for the top level files .
- These programming uses the diffing algorithm . Which keeps changing the version of the code .
- `PVM`
  - It stands for the python virtual machine .
  - Python is the interpreted language because of the pvm only .
  - It is the runtime engine.
  - Byte code is not the machine code .   
  - This is not the direct instruction to the hardware .
  - Python specific interpretation.
  - Cypthon,jyphthon,IronPyhton, Stackless.
  - For the stackless we use this in most of time for the concurrency .
