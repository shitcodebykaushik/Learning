#  The  first step
- In python everything  is object 
- Python is the interpreted language means it is excuted line by line by an interpeter without needing to be compiled into machine code first .
- Literal are the fixed values .
- This line of the code was written in the different file and then we impported this to 
```python
print("Hi kauhsik raj")

def chai (n):   # Here we define the simple function chai and def is the used as function in the python used to define a function. Which perform the specific task . Here chai (n) is the parameter . 
    print(n)    # This line of the code say that what the function chai will do with the n . HEre is prints
    
chai(4)  # This is the argument as we have passed the actual value into it .add()
chai('Kaushik Raj')

```
- This is the totally different file and we have import this . 
```python
from first import chai 
chai("Red_Level")
```

- Python also creates the byte code for the actual value which is slighly different from the java and other .
- When we download the python fine then there are actually  one more thing that is downloaded automatically which is python vm .
- Python code is converted into the compile then to the byte code , byte code is low level and the platform independent .
- Byte code run faster than the script code .
- `.pyc` is compiled python also known as the frozen binaries .
- `__pycache__` This is the system folder  generated by the internally and it is used for the imposted files and not for the top level files .
- These programming uses the diffing algorithm . Which keeps changing the version of the code .
- `PVM`
  - It stands for the python virtual machine .
  - Python is the interpreted language because of the pvm only .
  - It is the runtime engine.
  - Byte code is not the machine code .   
  - This is not the direct instruction to the hardware .
  - Python specific interpretation.
  - Cypthon,jyphthon,IronPyhton, Stackless.
  - For the stackless we use this in most of time for the concurrency .

# Python shell 
- In windows just type the python it will open the shell in the terminal .
- Python think the instructions as the computation .
- Python always looks for the things in the current directory first then it goes to the other repo .

# Mutable (Changable) and immutable (Not changable)
- In python everything is object which means that  every value is formed as the object in the memory .
- In python we have the garbage collector which automatically deletes unused objects.
```python
x=10
y=10
>>x
10
>>y
10
>>x=11   // Here we have changes the reference from the 10 to the 11 but our values is not deleted yet as the y still holds that value.
11
```
- Immuatable means we cant the change in the memory.
- Muatable means we can change the things in the memory .
- These are the totally different from the `const` and `var` .
- String are the immutable. Which mean the reference in the memory doesn't change . But when we change the refernce it automatically delted .
# Primitive Variable and the Expression 
- Python provide the  collections of primitive variables such as the integers floats and the strings
- A varibale is the name that refers to the value. A value represents objects of some type .
- Sometime we might see type explicity attached to the name of the variable like  `x:int = 44`, but the thing is here that we can define the multiple value of the different datatypes in the same memory location.
```python
x: int = 45,'Doge'
print(x)
```
# Data or Object Types both are the same 
- There are basically 
  - `Number` : 1234,3.14415,3+4j,0b111,Decimal(), Fraction()
  - `String` : 'spam',"Bobs",b's\x02'
  - `List`: This is the contgnious memoery space where we store the values . It always start from the zero index . []=>Bracket
  - `Tuples`: This is the ()Paranthese .
  - `Dictionary` : Here we uses the curly brackets {} and here values doesnt start from the zero index. key: value. `dict` the direct method to create the dictionary .
  - Set : set('abc'),{'a','b','c'}. In sets we always have the unique value it doesn't keep the duplicated value ,
  - `File` : open('eggs.txt;)
  - `Boolean` :True:False
  - `None:None` :
- Advance : Decoraters,Generatorm Iterators,MetaProgramming .

# Operators of the python 
Expression syntax is straightforward: The operator `+,-,* and / `.
- With the python it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate the power .
  ```python
  TECT =2 ** 3
  print (TECT)
```Python
Classic_division = 17/3    # This division returns the a float 
floor_division = 17//3     # This division removes the float 
Reminder_division = 17%3   # This division returns the remainder of the division .
print(Classic_division)
print(floor_division)
print(Reminder_division)
```
- Python supports the both the int ,float decimal and fractional and also have the built in complex numbers and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part .
- `int` This is the built in function which returns the whic removes the floating part and returns the integer part .
```python
ok =int(125.76)
print(ok)
```
- `float` This is the built in function which returns the floating points .
```python
ok =float(125)
print(ok)
```
- `Decimals`: Ideal for fixed-precision decimal arithmetic, especially in finance and where rounding errors need to be minimized.
```python
from decimal import Decimal 
price = Decimal ('19.99')
tax_rate = Decimal('0.05')
tax =price * tax_rate
total_price =price + tax
print(total_price)
```
- `Fractions`: Perfect for representing rational numbers and performing exact fractional calculations .
```python
from fractions import Fraction
ok = Fraction(1,2)   # This is similar to the 1/2
print(ok)
```
# Text 
 - `Text` is represented by the string data type. String is the sequence of the characters enclosed within either single quotes or double quotes or triple quotes.
 String are like ordered pairs of the collections, so you can access individual characters using their index and indexing starts from the zero .
 ```python
 text= 'label'
print(text)
rec = '''kaushik'''
print(rec)
ret = "kaushik"
print(ret)
 ```
- Slicing in the python  means the extract portions of a string(substring) using slicing .
```python
rec = '''kaushik'''
cut = rec[0:2]   # In this it will leve the last number of the index which is 2 . 
print(rec)
print(cut)
```
- `\n` is use to seprate the sting and print in proper formatting.
```python
new = 'doesnot\nok'
print(new)
```
- String can be concated together with the + operator , repeated with the * operator .
- String have the various methods for manipulations of theire contents .
```python
f= "kaushik is already enabled to connect"
print(f)
f =f.replace('kaushik is already enabled to connect', 'y') # As we know that string are the immuatble so now we have assign the new value
print(f)
```
```python
s='kaushik'
print(repr(s))  # use of the repr method helps to give the more informative information. 
```
```python
name = 2*'Kaushik'+'Raj' # Here we have concatenated the litrtal . We cant concate the two variables . 
print(name[0])  # Indices we use to print the values from the startings .
print(name[-1]) # negative indices we use to print the values from th ending.
```
# List 
- A list can be written as a list of the comma separated values(items) between square brackets,list might contain items that of differnt types but usually the items have the same types .
- List are the mutable means it can be modifies at the memory lable . 
- It is possible to nest the list . 
- Slice operation in the list return the new list containing the requested items.Which means that the list return the shallow copy of the list .

```python
ki = [1,2,3,43, 'Kaushil']
ki2 =2*ki + [1,2,3,43, 'Kaushi']
print(ki2)
cubes = [1,8,28]
cubes.append(65)
cubes.append(4**3)
print(cubes)
```
# Dictionaries 
- A dictionary is useful way to define an object that consists of named fields .
- Dict are mutable by default .
- Dict maintains the order in which itmes were created/added .
- 
```python
student = {
    "name": "kaushik",
    "roll": 4,
}
if 'nam' in student:
    
 print(student['name'])
 pass
else:
    print("Key not found")

```
```python
name={'name':'Kaushik','age':25}   # This is dict here 
print (name['name'])    # Calling the value from the key specific . 
print (name['age'],name['name'])  # It depends upon the nature of the call .
```
- Inside the dictionary we can use the different types of the data set too 
```python
Student = {
    'name':"Kaushik",
    'Address':"Law gate",
    'Email':"kaushik@gmail.com",
    'projects':["Dev",'Ops',"Go"], # List
    "performance": { 
        "2021": "Average",
        "2022": "Worst",
        "2023":"Tried"
        
    },
    'Hopes': "Dead"
}

print(Student)
print(Student['performance']['2023'])   # To acces the performance in the given dictionary we use the method of the nested extracting to fecth the vale
```
# Sets
- Sets are typically immutable objects repeatation of the values are not allowed .
```python
name = {'kaushik','kaushik'}
print(name)
```
- Union combines all the elements from two sets without duplicates .
```python

#Operations of the sets
name = {'kaushik',2,2}
fame = {'ias',2}
union = name | fame  # Union combines all the elemets without duplicates .add()
intersaction = name & fame # Interaction return the common to the both sets .
differnce = name - fame # return the elments that are in the first but not in the second 
symmetric_difference = name ^ fame # return the elements that are either in of the sets but not in the both .
print(union)
print(intersaction) 
print(symmetric_difference)
```
# If statements 
- It is used for the conditional execution, it selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expression one by one until one found to be true , if all the expressions are false then the suite of the else clause, if present is executed . 
```python
x = int(input("Plese input the value"))

if x < 0:
    x=0
    print("Negative changed to zero")
if x==0:
    x=0
    print("1 changed to the zero")
elif x==1:
    print("Single")
else:
    print("More")
```    
# While statements 
- It is used for the repeated executions as long as the expression is true .If the expression is set to be the false then it terminates it .
- In this the condition is retested again and the again until the expression becomes false , as the application becomes the fales it stops running .
```python

a =8
b=20
suffix = '.htm' if a>b else b
if suffix == '.html' :
    pass
elif suffix =='.htm' :
 print("The value is matched on the second chance ")
else:
    print("Invalid file")
```
# Break statements
- It is used to terminate the loop without executing the else clause .
# Continue statements 
- It is executes in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and goes back to the testing the expression .
# The for statement
- It is use to iterate over the any sequence of the objects in the order they appear in the sequence for list and the string both .

   - `range()` It is the function which is used to iterate over the sequence of numbers .
   ```python
   for i in range(5,20):  # The given endpoints is never the part of the generated sequence .
    print(i)
   ```
   - Note in many ways the object returned by the `range()` function behaves as if it is all list but in fact it is an object which returns the successive itmes of the desired sequence when you iterate over it but it doesnt really make the list,thus saving space .
   
# Try statements 
 - It is ysed to handle the exceptions. Those unexpected exceptions errors that can occur during the program exection . It allows you to gracefully manage the errors and prevent your program from crashing .
# Files input and the output 
```python
# file_object is the vaarible name that hold the value
file_object = open("output.txt", "w")  # This is function open up the file named output.text in write mode. It takes the two arguments one is file name and the other one is mode in which we want to write in the file . here is 'w' mode 
file_object.write("I am using this write the output") # This is the method that belogs to the file objects, It is used to write the data to the file . 
file_object.close() # This is the method that  closes the file which you were working on as it helps to ensure that any remaining data in the buffer is flushed and properly saved to file .
```
# Program Termination 
- 
```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
fruits.add('orange') 
print(fruits)
if fruits ==3 :
        print ('ok')
raise SystemError("Something is wrong with")
