#  The  first step
- In python everything  is object 
- This line of the code was written in the different file and then we impported this to 
```python
print("Hi kauhsik raj")

def chai (n):   # Here we define the simple function chai and def is the used as function in the python used to define a function. Which perform the specific task . Here chai (n) is the parameter . 
    print(n)    # This line of the code say that what the function chai will do with the n . HEre is prints
    
chai(4)  # This is the argument as we have passed the actual value into it .add()
chai('Kaushik Raj')

```
- This is the totally different file and we have importe this . 
```python
from first import chai 
chai("Red_Level")
```

- Python also creates the byte code for the actual value which is slighly different from the java and other .
- When we download the python fine then there are actually  one more thing that is downloaded automatically which is python vm .
- Python code is converted into the compile then to the byte code , byte code is low level and the platform independent .
- Byte code run faster than the script code .
- `.pyc` is compiled python also known as the frozen binaries .
- `__pycache__` This is the system folder  generated by the internally and it is used for the imposted files and not for the top level files .
- These programming uses the diffing algorithm . Which keeps changing the version of the code .
- `PVM`
  - It stands for the python virtual machine .
  - Python is the interpreted language because of the pvm only .
  - It is the runtime engine.
  - Byte code is not the machine code .   
  - This is not the direct instruction to the hardware .
  - Python specific interpretation.
  - Cypthon,jyphthon,IronPyhton, Stackless.
  - For the stackless we use this in most of time for the concurrency .

# Python shell 
- In windows just type the python it will open the shell in the terminal .
- Python think the instructions as the computation .
- Python always looks for the things in the current directory first then it goes to the other repo .

# Mutable (Changable) and immutable (Not changable)
- In python everything is object which means that  every value is formed as the object in the memory .
- In python we have the garbage collector which automatically deletes unused objects.
```python
x=10
y=10
>>x
10
>>y
10
>>x=11   // Here we have changes the reference from the 10 to the 11 but our values is not deleted yet as the y still holds that value.
11
```
- Immuatable means we cant the change in the memory.
- Muatable means we can change the things in the memory .
- These are the totally different from the `const` and `var` .
- String are the immutable. Which mean the reference in the memory doesn't change . But when we change the refernce it automatically delted .

# Data or Object Types both are the same 
- There are basically 
  - `Number` : 1234,3.14415,3+4j,0b111,Decimal(), Fraction()
  - `String` : 'spam',"Bobs",b's\x02'
  - `List`: This is the contgnious memoery space where we store the values . It always start from the zero index . []=>Bracket
  - `Tuples`: This is the ()Paranthese .
  - `Dictionary` : Here we uses the curly brackets {} and here values doesnt start from the zero index. key: value. `dict` the direct method to create the dictionary .
  - Set : set('abc'),{'a','b','c'}. In sets we always have the unique value it doesn't keep the duplicated value ,
  - `File` : open('eggs.txt;)
  - `Boolean` :True:False
  - `None:None` :
- Advance : Decoraters,Generatorm Iterators,MetaProgramming .
