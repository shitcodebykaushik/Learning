#  The  first step
- In python everything  is object 
- Python is the interpreted language means it is excuted line by line by an interpeter without needing to be compiled into machine code first .
- Literal are the fixed values .
- This line of the code was written in the different file and then we impported this to 
```python
print("Hi kauhsik raj")

def chai (n):   # Here we define the simple function chai and def is the used as function in the python used to define a function. Which perform the specific task . Here chai (n) is the parameter . 
    print(n)    # This line of the code say that what the function chai will do with the n . HEre is prints
    
chai(4)  # This is the argument as we have passed the actual value into it .add()
chai('Kaushik Raj')

```
- This is the totally different file and we have importe this . 
```python
from first import chai 
chai("Red_Level")
```

- Python also creates the byte code for the actual value which is slighly different from the java and other .
- When we download the python fine then there are actually  one more thing that is downloaded automatically which is python vm .
- Python code is converted into the compile then to the byte code , byte code is low level and the platform independent .
- Byte code run faster than the script code .
- `.pyc` is compiled python also known as the frozen binaries .
- `__pycache__` This is the system folder  generated by the internally and it is used for the imposted files and not for the top level files .
- These programming uses the diffing algorithm . Which keeps changing the version of the code .
- `PVM`
  - It stands for the python virtual machine .
  - Python is the interpreted language because of the pvm only .
  - It is the runtime engine.
  - Byte code is not the machine code .   
  - This is not the direct instruction to the hardware .
  - Python specific interpretation.
  - Cypthon,jyphthon,IronPyhton, Stackless.
  - For the stackless we use this in most of time for the concurrency .

# Python shell 
- In windows just type the python it will open the shell in the terminal .
- Python think the instructions as the computation .
- Python always looks for the things in the current directory first then it goes to the other repo .

# Mutable (Changable) and immutable (Not changable)
- In python everything is object which means that  every value is formed as the object in the memory .
- In python we have the garbage collector which automatically deletes unused objects.
```python
x=10
y=10
>>x
10
>>y
10
>>x=11   // Here we have changes the reference from the 10 to the 11 but our values is not deleted yet as the y still holds that value.
11
```
- Immuatable means we cant the change in the memory.
- Muatable means we can change the things in the memory .
- These are the totally different from the `const` and `var` .
- String are the immutable. Which mean the reference in the memory doesn't change . But when we change the refernce it automatically delted .

# Data or Object Types both are the same 
- There are basically 
  - `Number` : 1234,3.14415,3+4j,0b111,Decimal(), Fraction()
  - `String` : 'spam',"Bobs",b's\x02'
  - `List`: This is the contgnious memoery space where we store the values . It always start from the zero index . []=>Bracket
  - `Tuples`: This is the ()Paranthese .
  - `Dictionary` : Here we uses the curly brackets {} and here values doesnt start from the zero index. key: value. `dict` the direct method to create the dictionary .
  - Set : set('abc'),{'a','b','c'}. In sets we always have the unique value it doesn't keep the duplicated value ,
  - `File` : open('eggs.txt;)
  - `Boolean` :True:False
  - `None:None` :
- Advance : Decoraters,Generatorm Iterators,MetaProgramming .

# Operators of the python 
Expression syntax is straightforward: The operator `+,-,* and / `.
- With the python it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate the power .
  ```python
  TECT =2 ** 3
  print (TECT)
```Python
Classic_division = 17/3    # This division returns the a float 
floor_division = 17//3     # This division removes the float 
Reminder_division = 17%3   # This division returns the remainder of the division .
print(Classic_division)
print(floor_division)
print(Reminder_division)
```
- Python supports the both the int ,float decimal and fractional and also have the built in complex numbers and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part .
- `int` This is the built in function which returns the whic removes the floating part and returns the integer part .
```python
ok =int(125.76)
print(ok)
```
- `float` This is the built in function which returns the floating points .
```python
ok =float(125)
print(ok)
```
- `Decimals`: Ideal for fixed-precision decimal arithmetic, especially in finance and where rounding errors need to be minimized.
```python
from decimal import Decimal 
price = Decimal ('19.99')
tax_rate = Decimal('0.05')
tax =price * tax_rate
total_price =price + tax
print(total_price)
```
- `Fractions`: Perfect for representing rational numbers and performing exact fractional calculations .
```python
from fractions import Fraction
ok = Fraction(1,2)   # This is similar to the 1/2
print(ok)
```
# Text 
 - `Text` is represented by the string data type. String is the sequence of the characters enclosed within either single quotes or double quotes or triple quotes.
 String are like ordered pairs of the collections, so you can access individual characters using their index and indexing starts from the zero .
 ```python
 text= 'label'
print(text)
rec = '''kaushik'''
print(rec)
ret = "kaushik"
print(ret)
 ```
- Slicing in the python  means the extract portions of a string(substring) using slicing .
```python
rec = '''kaushik'''
cut = rec[0:2]   # In this it will leve the last number of the index which is 2 . 
print(rec)
print(cut)
```
- `\n` is use to seprate the sting and print in proper formatting.
```python
new = 'doesnot\nok'
print(new)
```
String can be concated together with the + operator , repeated with the * operator .
```python
name = 2*'Kaushik'+'Raj' # Here we have concatenated the litrtal . We cant concate the two variables . 
print(name[0])  # Indices we use to print the values from the startings .
print(name[-1]) # negative indices we use to print the values from th ending.
```
# List 
- A list can be written as a list of the comma separated values(items) between square brackets,list might contain items that of differnt types but usually the items have the same types .
- List are the mutable means it can be midifies at the memory lable . 
- It is possible to nest the list . 
- Slice operation in the list return the new list containing the requested items.Which means that the list return the shallow copy of the list .
```python
ki = [1,2,3,43, 'Kaushil']
ki2 =2*ki + [1,2,3,43, 'Kaushi']
print(ki2)
cubes = [1,8,28]
cubes.append(65)
cubes.append(4**3)
print(cubes)
```
